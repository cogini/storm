# Here is a sad story about PySQLite2.
# 
# PySQLite does some very dirty tricks to control the moment in
# which transactions begin and end.  It actually *changes* the
# transactional behavior of SQLite.
# 
# The real behavior of SQLite is that transactions are SERIALIZABLE
# by default.  That is, any reads are repeatable, and changes in
# other threads or processes won't modify data for already started
# transactions that have issued any reading or writing statements.
# 
# PySQLite changes that in a very unpredictable way.  First, it will
# only actually begin a transaction if a INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/REPLACE
# operation is executed (yes, it will parse the statement).  This
# means that any SELECTs executed *before* one of the former mentioned
# operations are seen, will be operating in READ COMMITTED mode.  Then,
# if after that a INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/REPLACE is seen, the transaction
# actually begins, and so it moves into SERIALIZABLE mode.
# 
# Another pretty surprising behavior is that it will *commit* any
# on-going transaction if any other statement besides
# SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/REPLACE is seen.
# 
# In an ORM we're really dealing with cached data, so working on top
# of a system like that means that cache validity is pretty random.
# 
# So what we do about that in this module is disabling all that hackery
# by *pretending* to PySQLite that we'll work without transactions
# (isolation_level=None), and then we actually take responsibility for
# controlling the transaction.
